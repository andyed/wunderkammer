# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-18

First public release.

- **Collection document** (`wunderkammer.collection`, version 1). A strict
  validator lists every problem with its path. The wall loads a document
  from `?collection=<url>`, from a `wunderkammer-collection` meta tag, or
  through `mount(element, collection)`, and needs no server.
- **Sprite-sheet covers.** A collection can name a few sheet pages instead of
  one file per image, with each image's own file as the fallback.
  `scripts/collection-sheets.py` packs them.
- **Comparison** (`wall/compare.html`). It compares two to six groups, shows
  counts or shares in an exact matrix, and walks the groups as racks of
  album walls.
- **Observations** (`wunderkammer.observations`). Claims cite matrix cells or
  items, the page computes their figures, and selecting a claim lights its
  evidence. Citations that do not resolve are shown, not dropped.
- **Hand-back.** `window.wunderkammer.export()` returns scope, focus,
  highlight and the exact items on the wall, or the evidence packet on the
  comparison page.
- **Local server.** `serve.mjs` serves Obsidian vaults, TiddlyWiki, image
  folders and music libraries, with saved piles and compact links.
- **Public-tree gate.** `scripts/check-public.mjs` checks the tree in CI.

Known issue: one experimental browser test, Canary A2 (HTML-in-canvas behind
a flag), fails. All other tests pass, and all 66 mutation cases are detected.
